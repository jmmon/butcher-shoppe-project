- Could combine servicesButchering and ServicesProcessing into a single card component which takes the info as props

- Could combine AboutUs and ComingSoon cards

- Could combine pageTitle and homepageTitle into single component
	- Could move the new title component into the app so it doesn't need to be listed in every page component

- could improve Button to also use a tag or whatever else needed for the different buttons

- Could break out form inputs into different components: Select component, text-input component, etc
	- select component,
	- textarea component,
	- input component,
	- (halfwidth input component?)
	- checkbox area component?
	- (individual checkboxes components?)
