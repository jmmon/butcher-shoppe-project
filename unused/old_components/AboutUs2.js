			<p>The vision and talent behind The Butcher Shoppe can be found in the hearts of 2 Stevens County families that partnered up to build a business that would serve their local community. The need for meat processing has been increasing in our end of the county as more of our neighbors want to control their own food production. Both our Mobile Farm Kill Truck and The Butcher Shoppe are intended to provide service that will help you meet your goals as a grower and a buyer. Instead of loading and hauling your livestock to a kill floor, dispatch can be done swiftly and responsibly on your own farm. Once your carcass is in our coolers, we will skillfully cut, cure, smoke and wrap your order according to your specifications. This includes wild game too! By taking the time to craft each animal into the artistic expression that will best suit your table, we hope to offer each of our customers a satisfying feeling of abundance for having chosen us to process your livestock. Our truck and our  facility are WSDA Inspected. We encourage you to take a look at our membership program as well.</p>
