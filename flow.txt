ordering flow, discounts for nearby people?:



** Discounts should apply to "the travel fees (?)", since that depends on how many people are scheduled on the same day **



(step 0): 
	- Look through website and read and gather information about how the service is provided

	- Once ready to submit an order, go to the Schedule page :



Section 1: Schedule {

		(step 1): (start scheduling)
			- Input farmkill data: 
					- we need the scheduled location, 
					- animal type(s), 
					- animal count(s), 
					- preferred time window
							- 30, 60, 90 days? 
							- minimum days out from the day of schedule? 30 days?
							- *preferred day of the week* for dispatch
							- *preferred time of month?*
							- *preferred time of day*
							- *or mark as no preference (for a small discount?)*
							- ("While we stive to meet your preferred days and times, we cannot guarantee you will be scheduled within your designated times.")

					- contact info
					- preferred contact route (email/text/both)
					- ( mark as "urgent"? (extra charge) )

				- "Once we confirm with you the date/time, we will notify you of which discounts may apply for this order."
				- ( outline the possible discounts and when they can be applied )


		(step 2): (animal cuts-data)
			- Option to "leave the cuts up to us" / "give us the standard cuts"

			OR

			- fill out forms one at a time for each animal
					- option to keep all animals one type cut the same
					- or submit separate cut forms for each cow, each pig, etc
					- option (again) to "leave the cuts up to us" / "give us the standard cuts" for this one animal (or for this one animal type)

				
		(step 3):	(verify and submit for waitlist)
			- double check all the info 

			- submit the data to the waitlist 
					- immediate confirmation email for "earliest date" and "latest date" and all the cuts info

			- "Please wait patiently to be contacted by phone (or preferred method? email?)"

} End Section 1



Section 2: Confirmation and notifications {

		(step 4): (get contacted to schedule the date)
			- scheduling of the exact date
			- scheduling of the estimated time window
					- ("this day between 9am and 11am")

			- include estimates/window for final meat pickup date
			- "These discounts MAY apply if you confirm this date/time:"
					- "neighbors/nearby" discount (per people confirmed on that day), 
					- (?) "If we confirm 5? or more appointments for this day, everyone on this day will receive our 'full day' discount",
					- "accepted on first confirmation" discount (i.e. remove this discount if they need to reschedule; inconvenience fee)
				
			- Option to decline until next available date? (no "accepted on first confirmation" discount)
			- Option to recind order completely? (Choose a different farmkill and processing service)


		(step 5.a): email/text notification 10? days before the date/time
			- notify if the order is eligible for a `travel fee` discount (5% per each other person scheduled on the same day?)

		(step 5.b): email/text notification 48? hours before the scheduled time
			- "How to prepare:"
			- "Discounts may apply (depending on these factors):"

		(step 5.c): email/text notification "morning-of" or "4? hours prior"
			- "Double check that you are prepared:"

} End of Section 2



Section 3: Day of Dispatch {
	
		(step 6.a): dispatch and pay (happens on the field)
			- final discounts and cost calculation
			- +/- extra charges / discounts (discretion of the crew/lead)
			- (What happens if we run late? Stay out late and maybe offer a discount to any kill that happens outside our normal 9am-5pm window?)


		(step 6.b): email/text notification the evening of the day?
			- "Thank you..."
			- "What's next?:"
					- details of processing
					- typical processing schedule
					- approximate final pickup window

} End of Section 3



Section 4: Pickup! {
	
	(step 7): email/text notification
		- "Your meat is ready to be picked up!"
		- "Our pickup hours:"
		- "Give us a call if you want to schedule a specific time for pickup"?
		- "Give us a call if you need to pick up outside our typical hours"


	(step 8): They arrive and pick up their meat!

} End of Section 4
