NOTE:
Might have localStorage hold an array of each animal that has been created, so we can pull up each customization by id. This
Then, have localStorage hold a reference to each of those individual customizations for submission of the data.
Finally, have a way to wipe the animal customizations from localStorage if they are not customized.
